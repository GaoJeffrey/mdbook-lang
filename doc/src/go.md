# Go

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

Go is often used for system programming, network programming, and distributed systems. It is also used for building web applications, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
