# C/C++

C/C++ is a system programming that lets you write programs that can run on any platform. It's a powerful language that can be used to write low-level programs, such as operating systems, drivers, and games. It's also a great language for learning programming.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
